# gonjademo

I was considering using [gonja](https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja) in
[my goss project](https://github.com/brothertoad/goss).  As with
the generic Go templates, I decided it would be worthwhile to
create a little demonstration application to make sure I understood
the API.  That's what this is.  It also uses
[the hpp module](https://github.com/Joker/hpp)
to pretty-print the resulting HTML.
